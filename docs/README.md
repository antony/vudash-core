A dashboard, like dashing, but written in NodeJS.

Vudash open source component
Writen using hapijs, lab, material ui, socket.io, lerna, and svelte

# Quick start
In so few lines:
```bash
  npm install -g vudash
  vudash create
  vudash
```

# Usage
Install as a global module `npm install -g vudash` and use `vudash create` to create an example dashboard.
Add new widgets under `/widgets` and add them to your dashboard under `/dashboards`.

You can visit your created dashboard by visiting http://localhost:3300/`dashboard`.dashboard - where `dashboard` is the name of a JSON file within the `/dashboards` directory.

Visiting the root of the application will yield a list of all available dashboards, unless the environment variable `DEFAULT_DASHBOARD` is set, in which case that dashboard will be loaded instead. Other dashboards will still be available via the normal methods.

If, like me, you learn by example rather than reams of documentation, check out the [Demo Dashboard's Configuration](https://github.com/vudash/vudash-demo/blob/master/dashboards/demo.json) on github. You can then clarify any questions using the documentation below.

# Dashboards
A dashboard is a collection of widgets separated into rows and columns.

## Creating Dashboards

Dashboards are in JSON format and take the form:
```javascript
{
  "name": "Happy",
  "layout": {
    "columns": 5,
    "rows": 4
  },
  "datasources": {
    "datasource-exchange-rates": { 
      "module": "@vudash/datasource-rest",
      "schedule": 30000,
      "options": {
        "url": "http://exchangerat.es/api/v1/rates",
        "method": "get",
        "graph": "rates.GBP" 
      }
    }
  },
  "widgets": [
    { "position": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 1, "h": 1}, "widget": "./widgets/random" },
    { "position": {"x": 3, "y": 0, "w": 2, "h": 1}, "widget": "vudash-widget-time" },
    { "position": {"x": 4, "y": 1, "w": 1, "h": 1}, "widget": "./widgets/github" },
    { "position": {"x": 0, "y": 1, "w": 2, "h": 1},
      "widget": "vudash-widget-statistic",
      "datasource": "datasource-exchange-rates",
      "history": 100,
      "options": {
        "description": "EUR -> GBP",
      }
    },
    { 
      "position": {"x": 4, "y": 2, "w": 1, "h": 1},
      "widget": "@vudash/widget-ci",
      "options": {
        "schedule": 60000,
        "user": "vudash",
        "repo": "vudash-widget-ci"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
Where 'widgets' is an array of widgets. The position in the grid (specified by `layout`) is indicated by the widget's `x` and `y` `position` values.

The values for `position.w` and `position.h` are the number of grid units the widget occupies in width and height, respectively.

The `history` attribute of a widget defines how many historical items a widget should store (i.e. where history is `X`, the widget will store `X` previous values) - the value history can be read by widgets, and used in things like graphs.

Widgets can be either a path to a directory containing a widget (see below), or an npm module of the same. If the widget is a npm module, you would need to `npm install --save <widget-name>` first.

### Environment variables

You can use environment variables in your dashboard or widget configuration:

```javascript
  { 
    "position": { ... },
    "widget": "@vudash/widget-ci",
    "options": {
      "user": "vudash",
      "repo": "vudash-widget-ci",
      "auth": {
        "$env": "ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME" 
      }
    }
  }
```

Where the value of `auth` in the configuration will be replaced with the contents of the environment variable `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME`.

## Custom CSS

You can add to (or override) the CSS for a dashboard, using the `css` attribute in your dashboard's json configuration.

Because the dashboard configuration is in JSON format, your CSS must be too, and uses the [json-to-css package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-to-css) to transform json into minified CSS.

As a (rather ugly) example, lets change the dashboard's background colour to red.

```javascript
{
  "name": "dashboard-with-custom-css",
  "layout": { ... },
  "css": {
    "body": {
      "background-color": "red"
    }
  },
  "datasources": { ... },
  "widgets": [ ... ]
}
```

As you can see, the hash under `css` follows the basic format of css, and is rendered into the dashboard after all the default vudash, and widget generated CSS.

# Widgets

Widgets are configured as an array in the `dashboard.json` file, in the format:

```javascript
"widgets": [
  {
    "widget": "./widgets/pluck", // widget file path, node module name, or class definition
    "datasource": "datasource-xyz", // name of a datasource listed in `datasources`
    "position": {
      "x": 1, // x position (row number) of widget
      "y": 1, // y position (column number) of widget
      "w": 1, // widget width in columns
      "h": 1  // widget height in columns
    },
    "options": { // widget specific config
      "your" : "config"
    }
  }
]
```

Widgets have some optional properties:

| property name | description                          | example |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| background    | css for "background" style attribute | #ffffff |

# Datasources

Unless a widget specifies its own data fetching method, data is fetched by a datasource.

Datasources are specified as a hash in the `dashboard.json` as follows:

```javascript
{
  "datasources": {
    "datasource-id": { // can be anything as long as it is unique
      "module": "../datasource-random", // as with widgets, a node module name or directory
      "schedule": 1000, // how often (in ms) the datasource should be refreshed
      "options": { // options for the datasource
        "method": "string"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each refresh, the datasource will fetch new data, and tell all widgets that listen to it about the new data.

# Configuration

When running the server, a number of environment variables are available:

| environment variable      | description                                                            | default value |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| DEFAULT_DASHBOARD         | specify default dashboard to mount at /                                | none               |
| DISCONNECT_RELOAD_TIMEOUT | default number of milliseconds to wait to reload if server disconnects | 30000         |
| API_KEY                   | api key used to access the vudash api                                  | (random)      |
| SERVER_URL                | external server url (for when node can't resolve it by itself)         | (inferred)    |

# Tips and tricks

## Securing your dashboard with basic auth

Want to protect your dashboard from the public eye? You can secure it with basic auth in a few steps:

1. Install basic-auth and http-proxy modules:

```javascript
npm i -S basic-auth http-proxy
```

2. Change the start script in package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./proxy"
  }
}
```

3. Create a simple proxy server called `proxy.js` in your project's root directory

```javascript
'use strict'

const http = require('http')
const httpProxy = require('http-proxy')
const auth = require('basic-auth')

const proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer()

function verify (credentials) {
  const user = process.env.BASIC_AUTH_NAME
  const pass = process.env.BASIC_AUTH_PASS
  return credentials && credentials.name === user && credentials.pass === pass
}

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const credentials = auth(req)
 
  if (verify (credentials)) {
    return proxy.web(req, res, {
      target: 'http://localhost:3300'
    })
  }

  res.statusCode = 401
  res.setHeader('WWW-Authenticate', 'Basic realm="example"')
  res.end('Access denied')
}).listen(process.env.PORT)

process.env.PORT = 3300
require('vudash')
```

4. When you run the project, don't forget your credentials:

```bash
BASIC_AUTH_NAME=username BASIC_AUTH_PASS=password npm run start
```

# Troubleshooting

* Q. The console shows that the websocket is failing to connect, and my widgets aren't updating.
* A. Your hosting provider might not be correctly reporting the external vhost of the server. Add an environment variable `SERVER_URL` with the full url to your server, i.e: `http://www.example.com/`

# Contributing

## Running Tests

Vudash > 5 is a monorepo! This makes it easier to contribute, and keep track of all the native plugins.

Clone the project and run:

```
lerna bootstrap
lerna run test
```

# Why create Vudash?

* I'll get to the point. I like dashing, but I don't like ruby.
* Both Dashing and Dashing-js are stellar efforts, but abandoned.
* Jade is an abomination.
* Coffeescript is an uneccessary abstraction.
* dashing-js has a lot of bugs

# Features

* will happily run on heroku, now.sh, or any other hosting you fancy.
* es6
* all cross-origin requests done server side
* websockets rather than polling
* websocket fallback to long-poll when sockets aren't available
* Custom widgets
* Custom dashboards
* Simple row-by-row layout
* Super simple widget structure
