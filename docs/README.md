A dashboard, like dashing, but written in NodeJS.

Vudash open source component
Writen using hapijs, lab, material ui, socket.io, lerna, and svelte

# Quick start
In so few lines:
```bash
  npm install -g vudash
  vudash create
  vudash
```

# Usage
Install as a global module `npm install -g vudash` and use `vudash create` to create an example dashboard.
Add new widgets under `/widgets` and add them to your dashboard under `/dashboards`.

You can visit your created dashboard by visiting http://localhost:3000/`dashboard`.dashboard - where `dashboard` is the name of a JSON file within the `/dashboards` directory.

Visiting the root of the application will yield a list of all available dashboards, unless the environment variable `DEFAULT_DASHBOARD` is set, in which case that dashboard will be loaded instead. Other dashboards will still be available via the normal methods.

If, like me, you learn by example rather than reams of documentation, check out the [Demo Dashboard's Configuration](https://github.com/vudash/vudash-demo/blob/master/dashboards/demo.json) on github. You can then clarify any questions using the documentation below.

# Dashboards
A dashboard is a collection of widgets separated into rows and columns.

## Creating Dashboards

Dashboards are in JSON format and take the form:
```json
{
  "name": "Happy",
  "layout": {
    "columns": 5,
    "rows": 4
  },
  "plugins": {
    "datasource-exchange-rates": { 
      "module": "@vudash/datasource-rest",
      "options": {
        "url": "http://exchangerat.es/api/v1/rates",
        "method": "get"
      }
    }
  },
  "widgets": [
    { "position": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 1, "h": 1}, "widget": "./widgets/random" },
    { "position": {"x": 3, "y": 0, "w": 2, "h": 1}, "widget": "vudash-widget-time" },
    { "position": {"x": 4, "y": 1, "w": 1, "h": 1}, "widget": "./widgets/github" },
    { "position": {"x": 0, "y": 1, "w": 2, "h": 1},
      "widget": "vudash-widget-statistic",
      "datasource": {
        "name": "datasource-exchange-rates",
        "options": {
          "graph": "rates.GBP"  
        }
      },
      "options": {
        "description": "EUR -> GBP",
        "schedule": 60000 
      }
    },
    { "position": {"x": 4, "y": 2, "w": 1, "h": 1},
      "widget": "vudash-widget-travis",
      "options": {
        "user": "vudash",
        "repo": "vudash-widget-travis"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
Where 'widgets' is an array of widgets. The position in the grid (specified by `layout`) is indicated by the widget's `x` and `y` `position` values.

The values for `position.w` and `position.h` are the number of grid units the widget occupies in width and height, respectively.

Widgets can be either a path to a directory containing a widget (see below), or an npm module of the same. If the widget is a npm module, you would need to `npm install --save <widget-name>` first.

# Widgets

Widgets are configured in the dashboard.json file, in the format:

```javascript
{
  "widget": "./widgets/pluck", // widget file path, node module name, or class definition
  "position": {
    "x": 1, // x position (row number) of widget
    "y": 1, // y position (column number) of widget
    "w": 1, // widget width in columns
    "h": 1  // widget height in columns
  },
  "options": { // widget specific config
    "your" : "config"
  },
  "datasource": {
    // datasource configuration for fetching data
  }
}
```

Widgets have some optional properties:

| property name | description                          | example |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| background    | css for "background" style attribute | #ffffff |

# Troubleshooting

* Q. The console shows that the websocket is failing to connect, and my widgets aren't updating.
* A. Your hosting provider might not be correctly reporting the external vhost of the server. Add an environment variable `SERVER_URL` with the full url to your server, i.e: `http://www.example.com/`

# Contributing

## Running Tests

Vudash > 5 is a monorepo! This makes it easier to contribute, and keep track of all the native plugins.

Clone the project and run:

```
lerna bootstrap
lerna run test
```

# Why create Vudash?

* I'll get to the point. I like dashing, but I don't like ruby.
* Both Dashing and Dashing-js are stellar efforts, but abandoned.
* Jade is an abomination.
* Coffeescript is an uneccessary abstraction.
* dashing-js has a lot of bugs

# Features

* will happily run on a free heroku instance
* es6
* all cross-origin requests done server side
* websockets rather than polling
* websocket fallback to long-poll when sockets aren't available
* Custom widgets
* Custom dashboards
* Simple row-by-row layout
* Dashboard arrangement is simply the config order (see below)
* Super simple widget structure

# Roadmap

 - Heroku easy deploy
 - You, sending Pull Requests.
 - Plugins
